## LHS/RHS operator
==================

Selects left or right side of equal-sign (or colon).

**you are required to map it by yourself**

Usage: 
```viml
" I use p/v as mnemonics for Property/Value
" but use anything you want
omap p  <Plug>(operator-lhs)
omap P  <Plug>(operator-Lhs)
omap v  <Plug>(operator-rhs)
omap V  <Plug>(operator-Rhs)

vmap =h <Plug>(visual-lhs)
vmap =l <Plug>(visual-rhs)
vmap =H <Plug>(visual-Lhs)
vmap =L <Plug>(visual-Rhs)
```
